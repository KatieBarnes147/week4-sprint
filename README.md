# Project #4 – JavaScript and Google Maps API

This project builds on my Week 3 Weather Dashboard by adding **Google Maps API** integration and connecting it to the **OpenWeather API**. Users can click anywhere on the map to retrieve real-time weather data for that location.

## **Project Links**

- **GitLab Repository:**  
https://gitlab.com/csc6304/2025/summer-2/Katie-Barnes/katie_barnes_week4

- **Hosted Page (GitLab Pages):**  
*(Will update after deployment)*

---

## **Features**
- Integrated **Google Maps JavaScript API** for interactive map display
- Click event listener on the map to capture latitude and longitude
- Asynchronous API calls to **OpenWeather** for real-time weather data
- Weather information dynamically rendered into the dashboard
- Responsive layout carried over from Week 3

---

## **APIs Used**
- **Google Maps JavaScript API** (for displaying the map and handling map events)
- **OpenWeather API** (for retrieving real-time weather data based on coordinates)

---

## **Setup Notes**
- I created a new Google Cloud project, enabled the Maps API, and added my API key to the script in `index.html`.
- I created a free OpenWeather account and used the API key to fetch live weather data.
- API keys are restricted to work only with my deployed GitLab Pages URL (once live).

## **How to Use**
1. Open the hosted page (link above once deployed).
2. Click on the map anywhere in the world to see current weather for that spot.
3. Use the input fields if you want to test city or manual latitude/longitude lookups (carried over from Week 3).
