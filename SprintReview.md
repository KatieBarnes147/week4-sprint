## üéØ Sprint Goal Review
**What was the main learning objective or goal for this assignment?**  
The goal was to integrate **Google Maps API** with my existing weather dashboard from Week 3, fetch live data from the **OpenWeather API**, and display it dynamically when a user clicks on the map. Additionally, I needed to deploy the project using **GitLab Pages** and properly restrict API keys for security.

**Did you achieve this goal? Why or why not?**  
Yes, I achieved the goal. I successfully connected both APIs, implemented map click functionality to fetch live weather data, and deployed the fully functional site to GitLab Pages with security restrictions.

## üìã What We Delivered
**What specific work did you complete this sprint?**  
I completed all ten tasks:  
- Cloned the Week 3 project into Week 4 repo  
- Integrated **Google Maps JavaScript API**  
- Implemented **map click event listener** to capture latitude and longitude  
- Added **asynchronous calls to OpenWeather API** using `fetch()` and `async/await`  
- Rendered weather data dynamically into the page when map is clicked  
- Restricted Google Cloud API key to my GitLab Pages URL  
- Deployed the project successfully to **GitLab Pages**

**What deliverables are you most proud of?**  
I‚Äôm proud of getting the APIs to work together seamlessly and setting up API key restrictions correctly, which was new to me. The final hosted version is interactive and secure.

## üìö Key Learnings
**What new concepts, skills, or knowledge did you gain?**  
- Connecting multiple APIs (Google Maps + OpenWeather)  
- Handling **asynchronous JavaScript** using `async/await`  
- Dynamically rendering API data to the DOM  
- Setting up **API key restrictions** in Google Cloud for security  
- Deploying interactive JavaScript projects to GitLab Pages

**What was the most challenging part of this sprint?**  
Configuring the Google Maps API key and troubleshooting the ‚Äúreferer not allowed‚Äù error after deployment.It was simple but I just did not know where to find the proper settings.

**How did you overcome obstacles or roadblocks?**  
I double-checked the GitLab Pages URL, updated the referrer restrictions in Google Cloud, and retested until the map loaded properly.

## üîÑ Process Reflection
**What worked well in your approach this week?**  
Breaking the assignment into smaller tasks and committing after each one made progress easy to track. Testing each feature (map load, click event, weather fetch) step-by-step helped identify errors quickly.

**What would you do differently next time?**  
I would set up the API restrictions earlier in the process so I could troubleshoot sooner, rather than waiting until after deployment.

**How effectively did you manage your time?**  
- [x] Very well - stayed on schedule  
- [ ] Fairly well - minor delays  
- [ ] Struggled - fell behind schedule  
- [ ] Poorly - significant time management issues

## ü§ù Collaboration & Resources
**What resources were most helpful?**  
The weekly lecture video, the weekly PDF, Google Maps and OpenWeather API documentation, and GitLab Pages documentation.

**If you worked with others, how did collaboration go?**  
I primarily worked independently but reviewed examples from lecture materials.

## üéØ Looking Forward
**What questions do you still have about this topic?**  
I‚Äôd like to learn how to extend this app with **searchable city markers** or **forecast data** for future enhancements.

**What would you like to focus on or improve in the next sprint?**  
Improving **JavaScript debugging** skills and API error handling.

**One thing you'll carry forward from this experience:**  
Breaking big projects into clear steps (cloning, API integration, deployment, restrictions) makes them much more manageable.

## üìä Sprint Rating
**Overall, how would you rate this sprint?**  
- [x] Excellent (5/5) - Exceeded expectations  
- [ ] Good (4/5) - Met most goals effectively  
- [ ] Satisfactory (3/5) - Met basic requirements  
- [ ] Needs Improvement (2/5) - Struggled but learned  
- [ ] Poor (1/5) - Significant challenges  

**Brief explanation of your rating:**  
This sprint gave me hands-on experience with JavaScript, APIs, and GitLab Pages. It was challenging but very rewarding to see everything come together and work in a live deployment.
